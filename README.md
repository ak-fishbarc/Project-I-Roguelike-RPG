# Project I: Roguelike-RPG
This is my project to practice basic Python coding. <br>
At the moment I'm not using any GUI library as a restriction, to give myself a challenge. In the future I might move this project to PyQT. <br>
Currently I'm working on implementing client/server multiplayer for this game. For now multiplayer works only as a chat but in the future it'll work on the basis of the game sending data to the server, in the background, while allowing players to chat.<br>
For now, I'm postponing this project as I'm working on another project in Flask.
